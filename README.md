# TalhaCoin

TalhaCoin is my first solo full-scale ethereum blockchain project. It was created a joke but deployed as if it were a production ready coin.

## ICO
I ICO'd the coin and donated the raised Ethereum to charity to get the whole experience of deploying token to the blockchain. 

--Transfer Receipt-- //TODO post proof transaction block link when ICO complete
